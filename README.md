#### [Random Scripts] (https://github.com/earphone/Just-BCS-Things)

* [AddBookmark2PDF](https://github.com/earphone/Just-BCS-Things/tree/master/Random%20Scripts/AddBookmark2PDF)
   This is a small script to help me by automating bookmark additions to a PDF.
  * Fill in 1st column of the excel with page numbers
  * Fill in 2nd column of the excel with bookmark titles associated with page number
  * Double click vbs script to run it
  * It'll ask you to choose a PDF file to add the bookmarks to
  * Says "Finished" when done

* [Clear Files with Extension](https://github.com/earphone/Just-BCS-Things/blob/master/Random%20Scripts/Clear%20Files%20with%20Extension.vbs)
---This is an even smaller script that deletes files in the same folder as the script of a certain extension that a user inputs.
--* Double click the vbs script to run it
--* Enter just the extension of the files that you would like to deletes
--* Shows all files that were deleted
